# GGCMaps - 8/25/2025

## Team Lost

### Description / Abstract
  - We have decided to work on the GGCMaps project. The original GGC campus map application is difficult to maintain and update because it is not built on a relevant framework. The primary objective of the GGCMaps Revamp project is to rebuild the application using modern technology with a modular structure to make it more maintainable in the future. Our plan is to use the existing SVG files as our campus layout and mix it with our created JSON files that will then be loaded by created scripts to make the data dynamic. We are using scripting created from python and JavaScript for dynamic data and using React and Next.js as our frameworks to make the project modular. Our goal is to have a modern campus map that is maintainable for any future developers an easy to navigate for any students.
